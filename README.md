##How to run
Currently this only runs locally on a live server. You'll need a Firebase DB setup and you'll need to create a .env file with the Firebase DB credentials. You will also need NPM installed on your local machine, and it helps to have the astro extension. I would reccommend using VSCode.

To run:
1. Navigate to the "Website" folder
2. Run "npm install" in your respective terminal
3. Run "npm run dev" in your respective terminal
4. Open your live server address
