cookTime: "30 Minutes"
directions: |
  1. Separate the ground beef into 3-ounce, loosely packed meatballs. A kitchen scale will come in handy here!
  2. Preheat a large skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes.
  3. Add bacon to pan and cook until fat has rendered and bacon is crispy, using a round grill press to keep bacon flat and speed up the cooking process. After 5 to 7 minutes, remove to a paper towel-lined plate.
  4. Increase the heat to medium-high and make two small piles of sliced onion, leaving plenty of room between each pile, then place the meatball over the onions. Batch your burgers two patties at a time in the pan.
  5. Smash the burger very flat, with the parchment as a barrier between the press and the hamburger. Repeat with the other meatball, leaving plenty of room for smashing.
  6. Cook for 2 minutes, or until you see the edges browning very nicely. Flip, add cheese, and continue to cook for 1 minute.
  7. Remove to a bun and repeat with remaining meatballs.
  8. Assemble burgers with your favorite burger accoutrements and aioli!
